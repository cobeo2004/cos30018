### Load data function. Check if exists data, if not then load and save from the `yfinance`
- **The major purpose of this function is to check if the unprocessed CSV file that contains the stock data from the start date and end date is existed in the file or not, if it is not existed then it will download the data from yfinance and save it to the directory that contains unprocessed CSV data. Otherwise, it will load the unprocessed CSV File. The following procedures are:**
    - The code will check if the directory that contains unprocessed CSV file exists, if not then it will start to create the directory and download the CSV from the yfinance. Once itâ€™s downloaded then it will convert the data to CSV Format and save it to the created directory.
    - However, in the case where the directory exists then it will read the file in that directory.

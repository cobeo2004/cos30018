  abstract      = "Prediction of stock prices plays a significant role in
                   aiding the decision-making of investors. Considering its
                   importance, a growing literature has emerged trying to
                   forecast stock prices with improved accuracy. In this study,
                   we introduce an innovative approach for forecasting stock
                   prices with greater accuracy. We incorporate external
                   economic environment-related information along with stock
                   prices. In our novel approach, we improve the performance of
                   stock price prediction by taking into account variations due
                   to future expected macroeconomic policy changes as investors
                   adjust their current behavior ahead of time based on
                   expected future macroeconomic policy changes. Furthermore,
                   we incorporate macroeconomic variables along with historical
                   stock prices to make predictions. Results from this strongly
                   support the inclusion of future economic policy changes
                   along with current macroeconomic information. We confirm the
                   supremacy of our method over the conventional approach using
                   several tree-based machine-learning algorithms. Results are
                   strongly conclusive across various machine learning models.
                   Our preferred model outperforms the conventional approach
                   with an RMSE value of 1.61 compared to an RMSE value of 1.75
                   from the conventional approach.",

  abstract      = "Prediction of stock prices plays a significant role in
                   aiding the decision-making of investors. Considering its
                   importance, a growing literature has emerged trying to
                   forecast stock prices with improved accuracy. In this study,
                   we introduce an innovative approach for forecasting stock
                   prices with greater accuracy. We incorporate external
                   economic environment-related information along with stock
                   prices. In our novel approach, we improve the performance of
                   stock price prediction by taking into account variations due
                   to future expected macroeconomic policy changes as investors
                   adjust their current behavior ahead of time based on
                   expected future macroeconomic policy changes. Furthermore,
                   we incorporate macroeconomic variables along with historical
                   stock prices to make predictions. Results from this strongly
                   support the inclusion of future economic policy changes
                   along with current macroeconomic information. We confirm the
                   supremacy of our method over the conventional approach using
                   several tree-based machine-learning algorithms. Results are
                   strongly conclusive across various machine learning models.
                   Our preferred model outperforms the conventional approach
                   with an RMSE value of 1.61 compared to an RMSE value of 1.75
                   from the conventional approach.",

  abstract  = "A firm's equity price on the stock-market is reported to be
               closely related to the Macroeconomic Variable (MVs) of the
               country in which the firm trades. For this reason, researchers,
               market traders, financial analysts and forecasters to examine
               the association between MVs and stock-price have carried out
               numerous studies, using time-series statistical analysis methods
               like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA),
               Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and Generalised
               Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH). However,
               these techniques are reported to suffer from limited predictive
               power and restrictive assumptions. Besides, in pursuit of ways
               to remedy these paucities and limitations within these
               techniques, some researchers have examined uncountable machine
               learning techniques for measuring the stock-markets trends and
               making trading decisions using macroeconomic variables. On the
               other hand, a higher percentage of these studies paid attention
               to the stock index prediction and neglected the diversity of MVs
               that influence different sector indices. In addressing the
               issues above, this study seeks to examine the degree of
               significance between different sectors stock-price and MVs and
               predict a 30-day head stock-price using Random Forest (RF) with
               an improve leave-one-out cross-validation tactic and Long
               Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTMRNN). An
               empirical analysis of the proposed model over the Ghana Stock
               Exchange (GSE) exhibits high prediction accuracy and better mean
               absolute error compared with other time-series techniques. It
               can, therefore, be inferred from the fallouts that the proposed
               stock-market prediction with MVs, provides an efficient approach
               to automatic identification and extraction of MVs that affect
               diverse sector stock and offer an accurate prediction of a
               stock's future price.",

                     of the stock market and how the market will behave next
                     decade because the world economy is now in an alarming
                     condition which leads to losses in the stock market. That
                     is why traders want to know a little bit about the future
                     forecast of the stock market. So, in this paper, we
                     approach a bit to predict the stock market using the deep
                     reinforcement learning method. Traditional methods for
                     stock price prediction often rely on statistical models or
                     technical indicators, which may struggle to capture the
                     non-linear patterns and sudden shifts in stock prices. In
                     recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has
                     emerged as a promising approach for predicting stock
                     prices, as it can learn complex patterns from raw data and
                     make decisions based on sequential actions. n this study,
                     we propose a novel framework for stock price prediction
                     using DRL. The framework incorporates a deep neural
                     network as a function approximator, which is trained using
                     the Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal actions for
                     buying, selling, or holding stocks. The neural network
                     takes historical stock price data as input and outputs
                     Q-values, which represent the expected rewards for
                     different actions at each time step. The best course of
                     action to pursue in each market state is then determined
                     using the Q-values. We performed a sensitivity analysis to
                     investigate the effects of various network designs and
                     hyperparameters on the effectiveness of our DRL-based
                     strategy. We found that the choice of hyperparameters,
                     such as learning rate and exploration rate, had a
                     significant impact on the performance, and tuning these
                     hyperparameters could further improve the prediction
                     accuracy. Our experimental results showed that our
                     DRL-based approach outperformed the traditional methods in
                     terms of predicting stock prices, with higher accuracy and
                     lower prediction errors.",
